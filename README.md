# Simple Web Calculator
This is a simple implemenation of a web calculator that can be run inside a web browser.  
Currently this implementation only configures the proper display of the components of the calculator, that is, the calculator only contains the visual elements of the calculator.  
The next steps to implement the funciton of the calculator would be to use Javascript to add event listeners for the buttons and maintain a number systerm.
